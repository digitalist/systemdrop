no need to reinstall. just add --> ipv6_activate_all_interfaces="NO" <-- to your /etc/rc.conf file

what's the recommended way to learn why system did  core dump and reboot? :-)
like logs, dumps etc. (latest unstable)
Mike
dmesg should probably be your first stop
then /var/log/$FOO
where $FOO is the application you are investigating
coredumpsi'm still learnign about myself
I don't recall where they are sent, but I bet the handbook knows ;)

system core dumps need to be turned on if I remember right - I can't remember the exact sysctl for it offhand though
Mike
enabling coredums is a choice during the install iirc
small flood
/etc/login.conf:    :coredumpsize=unlimited:\
/etc/login.conf:#    :coredumpsize=infinity:\
/etc/login.conf:#    :coredumpsize=8M:\
/etc/login.conf:#    :coredumpsize=infinity:\
/etc/login.conf:#    :coredumpsize@:\
/etc/login.conf:#    :coredumpsize-cur=0:\
/etc/login.conf:#    :coredumpsize-cur=0:\
/etc/login.conf:#    :coredumpsize=0:\
looks like /etc/devd.conf is promising as well
ahhh here we go
/etc/sysctl.conf:kern.coredump=0
set that to none zero to enable
er non zero

Thanks for looking that up!
Mike
np :)
grep core /etc/*
made it easy
:wink:
looks like /etc/devd.conf has options to enable automated debugging after a core dump amongst other things

thanks


/etc/sysctl.conf

Done:

$ grep -i dump /etc/sysctl.conf
# Disable coredump
# kern.coredump=0
# https://discourse.trueos.org/t/obtaining-kernel-core-dumps/731/2
kern.coredump=1
$ 

/etc/conf.d/savecore

    … Don’t forget …

Thanks. Done:

$ geli status | grep -i swap
label/swap0.eli  ACTIVE  label/swap0
$ grep -v \# /etc/conf.d/savecore

Make sure that the freetype module is loaded.  If it is not, add the following  

line to the "Modules" section of your X Windows configuration file:             

                                                                                

Load "freetype"



Add the following line to the "Files" section of X Windows configuration file:



FontPath "/usr/local/share/fonts/dejavu/"



Note: your X Windows configuration file is typically /etc/X11/XF86Config

if you are using XFree86, and /etc/X11/xorg.conf if you are using X.Org.

Message from xterm-330:

================================================================================

You installed xterm with wide chars support. This introduces some limitations

comparing to the plain single chars version: this version of xterm will use

UTF-8 charset for selection buffers, breaking 8-bit copy/paste support unless

you are using UTF-8 or ISO8859-1 locale. If you want 8-bit charset selections to

work as before, use "eightBitSelectTypes" XTerm resource setting.
